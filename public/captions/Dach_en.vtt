This is my old room in my mother's apartment in Esslingen. It's in the attic.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
I now live in Stuttgart, but since my girlfriend Marla is visiting,
we will be staying there for one or two nights.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
My bed is still there,
but it's also Bernd's workspace now.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
We agreed with him the day before that we would go
downstairs in the morning so that he could work undisturbed.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
So I wake up because the door to the upstairs opens,

00:33.562 --> 00:35.000
and in a semi-conscious state, I remember that
we have to go downstairs now.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
I walk to the stairs, look down.
Bernd is standing at the door

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
and I'm about to tell him that we're going downstairs.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
But he avoids eye contact, put off,
and says, "Stay in Bed, I changed my plans".

00:54.672 --> 00:57.407
That was the last time I saw Bernd alive.
